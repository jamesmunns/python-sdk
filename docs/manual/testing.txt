Testing 
=======

The source code distribution of the relayr Python library contains a testsuite
that can be run after downloading the full code archive. It is not installed
together with the Python package itself, but needs to be run from the unarchived
code distribution. This has been tested on Linux and OS X.


Testing on a single Python version
-----------------------------------

The test suite is located inside the ``tests`` subdirectory
and can be run using the PyTest_ framework which, unlike the ``unittest``
framework, does not require writing much boilerplate code. This allows, among
other things, reusing single test snippets more easily outside of the test suite.

To run the tests you don't even need to have PyTest_ installed, since the
archive contains a file named ``runtests.py`` which is essentially a minimized
version of PyTest_ itself (generated by the respective ``py.test`` tool).

Running the full test suite from the main directory of the unarchived code
distribution is as simple as this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python runtests.py tests

If you have PyTest_ installed (``pip install pytest`` will do) you can
ommit the ``runtests.py`` file:

.. code-block:: console

    $ py.test tests

In both cases the output should be something like this, when everything runs
correctly (the ``s`` indicates a skipped test, here because of platform limitations):

.. code-block:: console

    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform darwin -- Python 2.7.8 -- py-1.4.26 -- pytest-2.6.4
    collected 49 items

    tests/test_anonymous.py ............
    tests/test_bluetooth.py ss
    tests/test_config.py .
    tests/test_data_access.py ...ss.
    tests/test_registered.py ............................

    ================== 45 passed, 4 skipped in 103.02 seconds ==================

Of course, you can add more verbosity, run selected test modules or methods if
desired and much more. Please see the PyTest_ documentation for more information!


Testing on multiple Python versions
-----------------------------------

One other, and significant, advantage of using the PyTest_ framework is being able
to run the tests easily over a whole range of Python versions. A nice tool for
automating this is tox_, which can be easily installed with ``pip install tox``.
Given a short configuration file named ``tox.ini`` like the one provided in the
top-level directory of this package one can simply call ``tox`` to run the test
suite over multiple versions of Python automatically (below only the summary of
a run over four versions is shown):

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox

    =========================== test session starts ============================
    [ ... detailed output skipped here ... ]
    ================== 45 passed, 4 skipped in 103.02 seconds ==================
